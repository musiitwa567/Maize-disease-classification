# Maize-disease-classification
deep learning-based model capable of accurately detecting and segmenting maize diseases
The model is trained on a large dataset, consisting of annotated images with pixel-level labels for accurate segmentation. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted using a separate test set to assess the model's performance in detecting and segmenting maize diseases. Additionally, the trained model is deployed and tested on real-world maize field images to evaluate its effectiveness in practical scenarios.
